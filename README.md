# Leetcode Progress Watcher

Simple js script to fetch progress from leetcode profile.

Iska use bas data dene me nhi hai, future me is data to analyze krke ek live progress graph banana hai, isliye isko Progress Watcher bola hai, abhi ke liye bas record save krte rhega har roj.

### Usage

To get current progress (number of questions solved, etc.):

```sh
npm run start
```

* The relevant code is in `leetcode-watcher.js`
* The records are written to `records.json`
* `script.sh` is provided to setup crontab on linux locally. Plus I will add some functions to it to help the github action too
* A Github action will also maintain the `records.json` for names written on this repo's `watchlist.json`

### Future

Basically, I am collecting this data to analyse laterâ€¦ time is short currently :')

* Add github workflow for cronjob (refer https://github.com/adi-g15/archlinux-repository/tree/master/.github/workflows)
* Add a web interface (refer https://github.com/adi-g15/ipl_pred)
* Add graphing capability (can use plot.ly)

### Story
